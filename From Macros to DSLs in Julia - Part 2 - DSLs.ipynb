    "Now that you've worked through Part 1 of this tutorial, it's time to start putting your newly acquired knowledge to use by solving more interesting problems. To that end, we'll be writing substantially more complicated macros going forward. As macros get more complicated, they often start to resemble simple [domain-specific languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language), which I'll always refer to as DSL's going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Macros that operate on Julia expressions can be used to write [embedded DSL's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language#External_and_Embedded_Domain_Specific_Languages) that provide alternative semantics for existing Julia syntax, even though these DSL's must still strictly conform to Julia's existing syntax rules. If you want to provide novel syntax that isn't present in Julia, you can do so by writing a macro that takes in one or more strings as inputs. Julia's [non-standard string literals](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/#Non-Standard-String-Literals-1) are examples of this approach that come with additional syntactic sugar to make them seem closely integrated into the rest of the language. This approach to custom syntax via macros that take in strings instead of AST's is closely related to [reader macros in Lisp](https://letoverlambda.com/index.cl/guest/chap4.html). We won't discuss string macros in depth here, although there's an exercise at the end that you can do to experiment with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, you're going to implement several DSL's. To make it easier to handle the complexity of writing DSL's from scratch, we'll generally construct a sequence of increasingly complicated DSL's that are nested inside of each other. Adding complexity incrementality is a good way to make macro authoring tractable since handling the entirety of Julia's syntax by default can be overwhelming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these DSL's are not formally specified because we won't spell out a formal grammar or specification. This is common practice for Julia DSL's, although it also accounts for many cases in which Julia DSL's have surprising edge cases that were not considered by the DSL creators. Because these DSL's are just regular macros, they conceivably could be passed arbitrarily complicated quoted code, but they often won't be capable of processing such code. Providing good error messages is one of the tricks to writing great macros, but we won't go into it in detail. The provided solutions to some of the exercises demonstrate a few approaches to producing usable error messages."

    "\n",
    "Programming languages typically offer literals for many of their primitive types; Julia offers literals integers (`1`), floating point numbers (`1.0`), strings (`\"foo\"`), symbols (`:foo`) and more. Using these literals can make code more readable; to see why you benefit from them, imagine a language that only had string literals and required you to write `1` as something like `parse(Int, \"1\")`. You would probably find this pretty tedious.\n",

    "5. Think through the issues for and against allowing the macro to decide for itself whether the output graph is directed or undirected. Instead of allowing the macro to decide, do you want to use two distinct macros called `@graph` and `@digraph`? Does type stability matter for macros that act like literals? Why or why not?\n",

    "2. **Embedded Lisp**\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted earlier, you can support novel syntax using string macros. Based on ideas [from Peter Norvig's blog](https://norvig.com/lispy.html), implement a basic version of Lispy using a Julia string macro:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "lisp\"(+ 1 (* 2 3))\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Curve Plotting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a macro that plots a curve specified in terms of the assumed variable `x`. Make sure that you both make use of the expression as a function while also representing the expression incorrectly in the axis labels for your plot. For example, be sure the labels for these two calls produce different outputs even though they define the same functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@curve(sin(x + y), xlim = (-1, 1), ylim = (-1, 1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@curve(sin(y + x), xlim = (-1, 1), ylim = (-1, 1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Transformer DSL**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main uses of [non-standard evaluation](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Computing-on-the-language.html) in the R programming language is to support [Wilkinson notation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2346786?seq=1) for transforming tabular data into design matrices for modeling. Implement something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@transformer(z ~ 1 + x + factor(y))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should generate a transformer object that, when applied to a DataFrame, would generate the appropriate matrix. If you're unfamiliar with linear models, you should probably skip this exercise as the modeling issues are much deeper than the macro authoring issues."
